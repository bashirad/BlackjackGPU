## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to utilize the computational power of the GPU to train a model that can play Blackjack (also known as 21) optimally. Blackjack is a popular card game played between a player and a dealer. The objective of the game is to reach a hand value of 21 or as close to it as possible, without exceeding 21.

Traditionally, reinforcement learning algorithms for games have been implemented on CPUs (Central Processing Units). However, GPUs offer parallel processing capabilities that can significantly speed up the training process. This project aims to explore the potential benefits of GPU acceleration for learning to play Blackjack.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these installation instructions:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/blackjack-gpu-learning.git

Install the necessary dependencies. Make sure you have the following software installed:

### Python (version 3.6 or higher)
### CUDA toolkit (version compatible with your GPU)
### NVIDIA GPU driver

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and activate it:

Install the required Python packages using pip:

## Usage
Before running the project, ensure that you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU and the required software installed. Here are the basic steps to use the project:

Run the main script to start training the Blackjack model on the GPU:

The training process will utilize the GPU for accelerated computations. The script will output progress updates, training statistics, and save the trained model for future use.

Once the training is complete, you can evaluate the performance of the model by running the evaluation script:

The evaluation script will simulate Blackjack games using the trained model and provide performance metrics and insights.

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with different hyperparameters, or modify the implementation to suit your needs.
